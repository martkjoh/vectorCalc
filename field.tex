    The \verb|field.py| script is meant to be as close to vector calculus as possible. It uses $2\textrm{D}$ lists to describe a $2\textrm{D}$ scalar field, so that index $i$ corresponds to coordinate $x_i$, i.e. $f(x_1, x_2) \sim f[x_1, x_2]$.
    
    For $2\textrm{D}$ vector fields, however, we need another index to describe which component of the vector, at a point in $\textrm{R}^2$, we want. The first index is used for this, so that $f_i(x_1, x_2) = f[i, x_1, x_2]$. NumPy's \verb|einsum| allows us to preforme regular vector calculus operations on these fields. dot product is given by
    $$
    h(x_1, x_2) = \vec f\cdot \vec g = \hat e_i \cdot \hat e_j f_i(x_1, x_2)  g_j(x_1, x_2) = f_i(x_1, x_2)g_i(x_1, x_2),
    $$
    and becomes
    \begin{verbatim}
        h = einsum["ixyz, ixyz -> xyz", f, g]
    \end{verbatim}
    This is straight forward to generalize into 3D. 

    Defining \verb|eijk[i, j, k]| $ = \epsilon_{ijk}$, the Levi-Cevita symbol, allows us to implement the cross product of two fields, as
    $$
        \vec h = \vec f \times \vec g = \hat e_i h_i(x, y, z) =  \epsilon_{ijk} f_j(x, y, z) g_k(x, y, z)
    $$
    becomes
    \begin{verbatim}
        h = einsum["ijk, jxyz, kxyz -> ixyz", eijk, f, g]
    \end{verbatim}
    NumPys build in function \verb|gradient()| makes it possible to implement differential operators like the curl. As \verb|gradien(f, axis = i + 1)| takes the difference along axis coordinate $x_i$ (the $+1$ comes from skipping the component index), we can make a $5 \textrm{D}$ (!) matrix \verb|Df| with indexes such that $\partial_i f_j(x, y, z)\sim$ \verb|Df[i, j, x, y, z]|, and thus impmlement curl,
    $$
        \vec h = \nabla \times \vec f = \hat e_i h_i(x, y, z) =  \hat e_i \epsilon_{ijk} \partial_j f_k(x, y, z)
    $$
    as
    \begin{verbatim}
        h = einsum["ijk, jkxyz -> ixyz", eijk, Df]
    \end{verbatim}
